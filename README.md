# 🧠 AI-Based Human Behavior & Sentiment Analysis System

## 📖 Overview
This project is an AI-powered intelligent application designed to analyze human sentiment and behavioral patterns using real-world data. The system processes textual inputs (such as reviews, messages, or social media data) to identify emotional states and predict future behavioral trends.

The application demonstrates how machine learning and deep learning models can be used to support data-driven decision-making in domains such as business analytics, mental health monitoring, and user behavior prediction.
